# Sustainable-Investments-and-Diversification
Investors increasingly engage in socially responsible investments (SRI) and yet are
potentially unaware of the trade-offs they are facing. For instance, divesting from
stocks with low ESG performance implies losing the ability to have a fully diversified
portfolio, which in turn increases risk exposure. It is to date unclear to what extent
investors are aware of this and whether their portfolio allocations would be sensitive
to the resulting risk. To address these issues, we conducted an online portfolio
choice experiment with real-world investors. Between treatments, we manipulated
expected returns, diversification benefits, and social impact of the investment options
between treatments. Our results suggest that investors are willing to forego
diversification benefits to seek out green investments and avoid brown ones. We
further observe a higher tendency to refrain from investing in brown assets than to
pursue green assets. Further, our findings suggest that investors are aware of the
increased portfolio risk associated with engaging in sustainable investments.
